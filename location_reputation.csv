4906,Clay Nichols,"<p>I began my career working for consulting firms, then started my own software company and created 17 programs providing speech therapy to stroke survivors .  I marketed and sold it worldwide.  A few years ago, I fully automated my company so it wouldn’t need my involvement, freeing me for new challenges.  I’ve spent my career helping technical and non-technical stakeholders understand each other’s needs.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I returned to consulting, sharpening my skills in areas that I most enjoyed as a business owner. As I took classes and read a wide range of books, what particularly resonated was the importance of listening.  For example, each sale happens in the prospect’s mind. They know what they want. They’ll tell us if we ask and listen with genuine curiosity.   I first learned this selling our software. After I explained what a patient needed, caregivers often asked “how did you know exactly what we need?”.  I just smiled, never revealing my secret: I asked curious questions. You <em>told</em> me. I <em>listened</em>.  It turns out, that’s helpful in all sales, and all communication.</p>
<p>I’ve loved consulting with a variety of businesses, but I miss learning &amp; growing with a team working toward a common purpose.</p>

<strong>Elon Musk</strong> is my inspiration and very much admire him.</p>
<p>Started my programming with C++ when in 12th standard.That time we used <strong>Turbo C++ IDE</strong> for writing c++ program. I never wrote by my self other guys used to code I sit and watch every body what are they doing with that <strong>blue screen</strong>.</p>
<p>Some how learned C++ and then moved to Java.</p>
<p>It was <strong>love</strong> at first glance .</p>
<p>After Java I switched to C# for developing games in Unity.C# is very much similar to Java infact if was designed to be similar to Java.C# was designed by <strong>Anders Hejlsberg</strong> he initially called it cool &quot;C-like object oriented language&quot; later renamed it to C# for sometrade mark issues.</p>
<p>On my free time I might be developing games in Unity or making some utility applications or solve problems in Hackerearth.</p>

6886,Wyatt,"<p>Software engineer, security evangelist, and motorcycle enthusiast and probably a little more jaded than most.</p>

<p>I grew up in the country, with out access to ""the real internet"" or a lot of technology ... but I always loved messing with it at school. My first programming language was QBASIC. The amount of hours and time I spent working to come up with interesting things like random number generators based on GOTO statements is probably equivalent to some of the times that people have spent on World of Warcraft, but it taught me that software could be almost anything I wanted to make it.</p>

<p>I earned a Bachelor's degree Computer Science in Engineering at the University of Cincinnati after learning that wires had mass (leave that to those Computer / Electrical Engineers) and that I liked 0's and 1's more than K-maps. At the University, I worked with everything from developing a CPU from scratch, to x86 assembler, to OpenGL on C++ for a racing game we developed.</p>

<p>While an undergrad, I co-oped for several companies and spent just as much time helping them with their COTS software solutions as building applications to solve internal challenges.</p>

<p>When you take all of that, combine it with the fact that I've had a job as a horse farmer, a car salesman, grease monkey, and a shoe cobbler, I used to have a hard time answering the question ""What do you do?"" ... my answer these days?</p>

662194,Kanishka,"<p>Ever since I was a little kid, programming has been my passion. I still remember sitting in front of an IBM PS/1 with MS-DOS floppy loaded in, making it print &quot;Hello, K&quot; in BASIC for the very first time. As I explored BASIC, it was almost like magic; being able to make the computer do whatever I wanted.</p>
<p>Throughout middle and high school, I started learning the programming languages I could get my hands on, starting from Lotus. I learned C, then C++. It was just too exciting.</p>
<p>The passion carried me through my education in Bangalore. There was plenty of resources and people with similar interest. It was a dream come true. I studied new languages, algorithms, compilers, system programming all with the same fascination that drove me as a kid. And it was here that I learned, truly how much there was yet to learn!</p>
<p>So, now, in the industry, this passion remains with me. I am always getting opportunities to learn new languages, solve problems and building apps. And for this, I am very grateful.</p>
<p>Languages that I love the most: Go, Swift and Vue.js
Favourite editors: GoLand, Visual Studio Code and Xcode</p>",,2011-03-16 09:28:51.193 UTC,2021-05-28 06:50:21.473 UTC,Singapore,1037,58,5,257,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/kanishka-nagaraj/

I started out making simple graphics with Haskell on his website <a href=""https://code.world/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://code.world/</a>, soon we made simple games. Once I learned the basics of OOP, I began learning Python.</p>
<p>I made a few widgets for my self, but never really developed with Python professionally. At the age of 13, I saw an issue with the way trap tournaments were run. I had decided to create my first public application On-Deck Shooting Apps. It was used at a few small clubs here in Colorado.</p>
<p>About 6 months into the project, my application was seen by the owner of a software company for trapshooting. He offered me a job. Since then I have been working with many different technologies. On a day-to-day basis, I work with C# (WinForms/WPF/Xamarin), C++, PHP, AWS, and jQuery.</p>
<p>Once I graduated High School, I started taking classes at a local community college. I had decided that I wanted to start working towards a business degree and a computer science degree. However, they did not allow their students to double major. Therefore I decided to go for certificates, and along the way earn my Associates of General Studies.</p>
<p>If being in college and working full time was not enough, I still like to challenge myself by learning new technologies. Right now I am taking a course on ASP.NET core, and another on Xamarin via Udemy. To help sharpen my skills.</p>
<p>I also like to develop my own hardware, I fill up my spare time by making Arduino/Raspberry pi devices. I prototype on a breadboard then design and order PCBs and assemble them myself. Some are IoT devices others come into play at work.</p>
<p>I am just an all-around nerd that loves to learn and experiment with anything electronic I can get my hands on.</p>",,2013-02-14 22:06:52.483 UTC,2021-05-30 00:30:58.630 UTC,"Colorado Springs, CO",3005,876,89,1116,https://i.stack.imgur.com/mHxGk.png?s=128&g=1,http://marcellobachechi.dev

From 2000 to 2005 I developed and designed a variety of VB6 and VB.NET applications; both web-based and Windows Forms applications.  From 2005 on, I have primarily focused on .NET and Microsoft technologies with my preferred language being C#.  A large percentage of my projects have involved tying disparate, multi-platform information into cohesive, user-focused, web-based applications.  </p>

<p>At the core of successful application development is the SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle).  I don’t just say this as propaganda, I truly believe this and have seen it proven repeatedly.  I am an excellent project manager, architect, application developer, database developer as well as business analyst, which has placed me in the lead position of multiple projects with my current and past employers.</p>",,2014-02-11 16:46:37.227 UTC,2021-05-28 16:22:08.183 UTC,"Hollywood, FL",476,235,28,80,,http://Xceladus.com

7384740,Dodge,"<p>&quot;Perseverance - a lowly virtue whereby mediocrity achieves an inglorious success.&quot;</p>
<p>Ambrose Bierce, <em>The Devil's Dictionary</em>, 1911</p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;The acts of the mind, wherein it exerts its power over simple ideas, are chiefly these three: 1. Combining several simple ideas into one compound one, and thus all complex ideas are made. 2. The second is bringing two ideas, whether simple or complex, together, and setting them by one another so as to take a view of them at once, without uniting them into one, by which it gets all its ideas of relations. 3. The third is separating them from all other ideas that accompany them in their real existence: this is called abstraction, and thus all its general ideas are made.&quot;</p>
<p>John Locke, <em>An Essay Concerning Human Understanding</em>, 1690</p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;Every young farmboy knows that the hardest and noblest wood has the narrowest rings, that high on the mountains and in continuing danger the most indestructible, the strongest, the ideal trees grow.&quot;</p>
<p>Hermann Hesse, <em>Wandering</em>, 1920</p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;Being an amateur, a free lance who never held any academic post or had any professional status, I had the rather unusual advantage of considering problems with an open mind, unbiased by traditional textbook ideas that had remained untested against facts.&quot;</p>
<p>Ralph Bagnold, <em>Sand, Wind, and War: Memoirs of a Desert Explorer</em>, 1991</p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;It is a sad thing to think of, but there is no doubt that genius lasts longer than beauty. That accounts for the fact that we all take such pains to over-educate ourselves. In the wild struggle for existence, we want to have something that endures, and so we fill our minds with rubbish and facts, in the silly hope of keeping our place. The thoroughly well-informed man--that is the modern ideal. And the mind of the thoroughly well-informed man is a dreadful thing. It is like a bric-a-brac shop, all monsters and dust, with everything priced above its proper value.&quot;</p>

<p>Welcome to my world –</p>

<hr>

<p>I love developing, designing and securing software.</p>

<p>I love multitude of software domains – Android / Linux based Firmware (ROM) development, communication protocols, mobile apps, Cyber, IOT &amp; embedded, and I had the priviliege to gain deep experience in each through out my 19 and some year old career – beginning as a programming officer at IDF, continuing as a Senior Software engeneer in a number of Israeli high tech companies &amp; Startups, then building and leading my own software teams at companies I started. Today I simply enjoy the joy of code from my home office located in the town of Tzur Yizhak in Israel.</p>

<p>I enjoy the challenge of research. It started when I began my academic career at the age of 16, continued with my Masters Thesis in the field of DCSPs (Distributed Constraints Satisfaction Problems), and then went to Cyber, IOT and bioinformatics. I love learning new fields, finding new ways of solving interesting problems.</p>

4597,Pierre Arnaud,"<p>Pierre Arnaud is a long-time software enthousiast who likes to consider himself as a craftsman.</p>

<p>As a kid, he wrote programs on a mechanical typewriter, imagining what the computer would do with his BASIC programs. In 1982, he bought his first 8-bit CPU (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RCA_1802"" rel=""nofollow"">RCA 1802</a>) which he programmed in binary, by toggling switches.</p>

<p>In 1984, he discovered the <a href=""http://www.smaky.ch"" rel=""nofollow"">Smaky</a> at the local school and started experimenting with new programming languages, such as PASCAL, LOGO, PROLOG, etc.</p>

<p>On Christmas 1985 he received a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_128#Commodore_128D"" rel=""nofollow"">Commodore 128D</a> from his parents, on which he developed his first real applications: a drawing program, followed the next year by a text processor.</p>

<p>In 1991, he wrote his first implementation a LISP interpreter for the Smaky computer. He had already acquired some experience developing system software, applications and drivers in CALM assembly language for the Smaky OS.</p>

<p>A few years later, he gradually switched from assembly language to C++ and contributed a port of GCC and Ghostscript to the Smaky. He also developed the <a href=""http://infini.smaky.ch/"" rel=""nofollow"">Smaky emulator</a> and the last Smaky hardware (Smaky 400).</p>

<p>Now, he is still happy developing software, but mainly in C#...</p>

<p>The first code I hunt and pecked into a TRS-80 was a paint program listed in one of my father's computer magazines.  I didn't really understand what all the funny characters meant, but I saved it off to a magnetic tape and never had to type it in again.</p>  

<p>My first paid coding job turned up when I was thirteen years old.  A neighbor down the street was planning on writing a book on various card games.  My task was to write interactive card playing routines in BASIC to be included as examples in the book.  The book was never published, but I was paid more money in one summer than I probably had rights to.</p>

<p>My first job after college was working on accounting software in Java.  It was just a six month gig, but I met some memorable people and learned many lessons that I rely on to this day.</p>

<p>A few years back, I founded my first company with a couple of partners.  <a href=""http://www.milyli.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Milyli</a> is a Microsoft .NET shop where we customize various document management platforms including SharePoint and we encourage folks to make it like you like it.

605875,Tyler,"<p>I have been programming since I was in high school which got me hooked. I started by building websites and doing graphic design until I made my first online game to play Risk in my early 20’s. It was a small community of around 2000 members, but I was the sole creator using my friends custom built MVC framework he called Tru. Later building more complex websites to manage as many tasks as possible in different organizations to help automate mundane tasks.</p>

<p>I’ve lived in Germany, Thailand, Cambodia, and South Korea. I’ve spent much of my life traveling as a missionary and training others on how to develop things, whether websites or games. I speak Thai fluently and very basic German.</p>

<p>My passion is automation and organization. I thrive in tasks where I can accomplish one of these passions. Organizing massive amounts of information into easy to read and process data or simplifying tasks to allow programs to do the majority of the work. I am very focused on usability and I highly depend on tests to take away the stress of worrying that changes will break something else. The more situations a test can account for the better.</p>",,2011-02-07 02:44:42.757 UTC,2021-05-29 20:20:02.917 UTC,"Bangkok, Thailand",3519,413,5,472,https://i.stack.imgur.com/omHJw.jpg?s=128&g=1,

<h1><a href=""https://joelpurra.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The ace up your sleeve</a></h1>

<p>I do freelance software development consulting. Adding new features, refactoring old systems, building entire greenfield projects and MVPs from scratch. Primarily short-term contracts (0-3 months with option to extend), optionally part-time (8-40 hours per week), mostly working remotely. Subcontracting accepted.</p>

<p>Hands-on software development in the entire stack as well as code reviews, designing system architecture and being an interim CTO. Emphasis on quality code with tests. With a wide range of skills and experience, I enjoy being the go-to guy. Working full-stack, but prefer backend over frontend.</p>

<p>Grew up in an entrepreneurial family and have been running businesses since high-school. Co-founded several e-commerce sites, built tools for the government, done internet/security research, released dozens of open source projects, advised developers and startups. Have a master's degree in information technology and engineering, army officers' training, traveled the world with my backpack, lived in several countries. Prefer to have a flexible lifestyle; am currently a freelance contractor/consultant.

2580812,Prabakaran Thodithot Sembiyan,"<p>An enthusiastic and ambitious WSO2 Certified Solutions Architect with 9 years of experience, who is an active learner of current trends in WSO2 stack. I can adapt to any kind of situation provided there is a space for learning new things daily.</p>
<p>I have set up a complete integration platform using WSO2 components like Identity server for Identity and Access Management, Enterprise Integrator for API development and service orchestration, Data Services Server for RDBMS integrations, Salesforce connectors for CRM integration, Amazon connectors for NoSQL database integrations and Amazon services integrations.</p>
<p>I recently used Enterprise integrator (v 6.1.1) and have used Enterprise Service Bus (v4.0.3, v4.8.0, v4.8.1, and v4.9.0) heavily for service orchestration, message transformation, message mediation and content-based routing of the incoming messages. I develop both SOAP proxies and REST APIs using Enterprise Integrator/Enterprise Service Bus.
In the APIs I develop, I have a sophisticated Error Handling Mechanism which sends out an email notification to the developer/support forum whenever there is a Runtime exception like network glitch, backend system unavailability, and request timeouts. The Error Handler also sends a notification when there is a premeditated error which has to be notified to the users. The email consists of the error details including the exact file where the issue has occurred. I also have an audit mechanism that keeps track of every request that comes to the server and its responses.</p>
<p>I have used WSO2 Identity Server v 5.4.0 for Identity and access management. I have developed the following use cases in my latest project.</p>
<ul>
<li>User Management (with two-factor verification)</li>
<li>Role Management</li>
<li>Permission Management</li>
<li>Social Media Integration (Google Plus, Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn)</li>
<li>OpenId connect Login/Logout</li>
<li>Role/Permission-based access to the site/application</li>

Previously, I worked for RELx/Reed Elsevier Group as a Java/Scala data integration engineer in the Spark/Hadoop space during my time at NVISIA, LLC in Chicago.</p>

<p>I began my journey at age 11 with VB6 and VB.NET. My interests and past projects span things such as game development (high-level scripting down to writing my own OpenGL/DirectX rendering engine, and contributing to the Leadwerks Game Engine, CryEngine, and UDK), general utility framework development and personal/enterprise software applications design/development, web design and UI/UX specialization, music product &amp; sound design, electrical engineering (prototyping gadgets, but mostly reverse engineering circuits and breaking things that use electricity), building computers for all types of specialized purposes, trying to understand global economics (my college major), starting a new business every few years trying to be the next Warren Buffet, Bill Gates, or Mark Cuban. </p>

<p>My newest interest and passion is big data and the analytics behind it. My day job involves building the world's largest analytics-friendly product database for web and mobile applications, B2C &amp; B2B business applications, and social networking. Hoping to make the world a better place.</p>

<p>I've came to Stackoverflow for years now, feeding off answered questions to improve my own code or solve issues I was too lazy to ask questions about, but as of 2015 that has ended, and I now frequent here to give back more than I have taken, whiel continuing to broaden my knowledge and find answers to pesky programming conundrums that are mainly due lack of reading documentation, following zen principles, or coding while asleep.</p>",,2014-07-24 18:23:39.490 UTC,2021-05-06 07:56:40.937 UTC,"Warren, OH, United States",1486,276,3,138,https://graph.facebook.com/1672520991/picture?type=large,http://tylerjharden.com

2029050,Claude Catonio,"<p>Hi all</p>

<p>I'm .Net Architect for a small company.</p>

<p>I started to work as IT professional 15 years ago. I started on Mainframe in PL/I. Then I worked 9 years as Java Architect. And the last 3 years, I've worked in C# to build Silverlight / WCF applications and frameworks. Now, I focus more on WPF development.</p>

<p>Regards
Claude</p>",,2013-01-31 12:36:55.770 UTC,2019-08-05 20:01:51.133 UTC,,721,0,0,27,https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/df2e3211e37388a2c4788865eb14b480?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1,http://ccmlits.net

1288934,Tyson Joseph Bedwell,"<p>I have had a vested interest in technology from a very early age. I spent my school years working part time, gaining valuable experience working for and eventually functioning as a team lead for a small Managed Service Provider. From building computers, to developing Active Directory home labs and learning the ins and outs of Linux server administration, to basic software development, I started experimenting with tech and learning at a very young age and never really stopped, eventually leaving school and going straight into full time employment at another MSP which is where I am currently working and honing my skills further.</p>

<p>My core skills and experience focus areas range from:
 - Active Directory planning, implementation and management
 - Software and hardware networking
 - Windows Server (versions 2008-2016)
 - VMWare ESXI and vCenter implementation and administration
 - Citrix administration
 - Linux, including bespoke Samba4 Active Directory domain implementations (my core focus at a prior employment)
 - Microsoft Exchange 2007-2016 and Linux mail server deployments and administration
 - Microsoft SQL Server (including in failover clustered configurations) and MySQL
 - Microsoft IIS Server (in NLB configurations and standalone) with PHP and ASHP
 - Software development and coding in a variety of languages; C#, POSH, PHP, HTML5, CSS, JS, PYTHON to name a few
 - VoIP Telephony implementation and administration</p>

<p>My certifications range from network-related (Comptia Network+) to telephony-related (3CX Certified Engineer).</p>

<p>I'm always up for a chat about tech, or just about anything really. Feel free to say ""hi""!</p>",,2012-03-23 18:32:41.160 UTC,2021-04-11 14:35:00.847 UTC,"Ipswich, United Kingdom",48,0,0,17,,

I formerly worked at Microsoft Corporation as a Senior Program Manager (the code-writing, engineering type) for the Microsoft Azure Customer Adoption Team (AzureCAT), within our Cloud and Enterprise division. My focus while at Microsoft was upon large, complex projects and next-generation activities for our internal and external customers of our Azure engineering team. My sub-specializations include compute services, networking, IoT devices, Linux, and cloud security, privacy and compliance. Prior to my career at Microsoft, I gained experience in a few major areas: enterprise architect for a large, well-known multinational shoe manufacturer; ran my own Information technology consulting and training company in Southeast Asia; was an international bakery consultant; and did some work in public safety, including law enforcement, fire service, and emergency medicine.

Started at the age of mainframes, got involved in micro-computing before IBM PC and Apple were even brand names, wrote drivers, bootstraps, etc. Then progressed with Unix  (and of course anything Windows).

I have coded challenging stuff in just about any languages or tools that ever came out. If I were to list them here, it would just sound like I'm bragging, but I am not.</p>

<p>When I look back at my career, I guess I was fortunate enough to not be stuck in any particular domain. However, I have purposefully tried to avoid developing additional expertise in Windows 1) because I knew the market was going to be saturated, 2) because Windows customers expect to pay little to nothing for everything.</p>",,2013-03-14 15:17:11.690 UTC,2016-08-12 16:22:11.160 UTC,,517,1,0,21,,

<p>I started programming during freshman year of high school with Visual Basic, developing simple programs like a word processor, MD5 file scanner, and an internet browser.</p>

<p>Currently, my forays are into studying Node.js, a Javascript environment that runs server-side, and Go, which provides to be a viable alternative to Node.js for situations where code duplication isn't necessary between front and back-ends. Both provide very rapid response times, which is one of my main problems when developing intensive PHP applications.</p>

3543503,froth,"<p>Old time programmer. My native language is Fortran. My current favorite toy is the Intel(r) Xeon Phi(tm) coprocessor. And yes, I'm an Intel employee.</p>

<p>First full time programming job was on a CDC7600, using NOS. (I used a 6600 for my masters degree.) I then moved on to Cray machines, using COS on a Cray-1 (and for a while on the Cray XMP) and Unix (System V) on the Cray-2 and later machines. I have worked on every Cray system from a Cray-1 to a T90 as well as the T3D and T3E. In addition to the Cray systems, I have played around on a number of different MPPs, both SIMD and MIMD. </p>

<p>The most fascinating machine I ever had the opportunity to work on was the Tera MTA - multinode, up to 128 threads per node, flat shared memory, able to use a single common multithreading scheme (basically OpenMP) for a program spread across the whole machine. Not an easy machine to built, however. Since then I have been mostly on clusters using Linux. Now days, I get to play with the Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor, which is a cool architecture, too, and much more buildable - up to 61 cores, 4 threads per core, shared memory AND SIMD vectors.

995830,bitcoinero,"<p>As a complete autodidact and perpetually inquisitive software engineer for over 12 years, I have spent the last few of them as an SDE II for Microsoft at their headquarters in Redmond, WA. During that time I worked on several large, visible and innovative projects while using strict Agile and Extreme Programming methodologies. </p>

<p>However, much has changed since then. One day, after a bottle of wine, I chose to leave that promising career at Microsoft to travel, live a little more and explore a few project on my own. The first few failed miserably. I eventually joined a software consulting startup in its infancy, located in Spain, with an uncertain, but promising future, as their CTO, responsible for all vision, development, planning, project management, infrastructure, hiring and support for the entire technical side of the business; tough? Yes, but I can proudly state that the firm has grown from 1 to 16 employees, and we reached sales of $1 million at the end of its third year! We have inclusively launched our line of software, which was featured on prime time TV and in several reputable newspapers. Not a bad achievement, but it was a few tough years.</p>

<p>I have since then moved into the cryptocurrency space, in which I had already been involved since late 2011 and had been involved with Bitcoin and its underlying technology since almost the very beginning. I

974695,Douglas Starnes,"<p>For close to a decade, I have performed a number of functions in the field of software engineering. This has exposed me to a wide variety of platforms, languages and tools. So I show allegiance to no particular philosophy or technology. At the same it has revealed strengths which I focus on and exploit.</p>

<p>My primary focus is on data science and machine learning particularly deep learning. I am a frequent author and speaker on these topics including TensorFlow, scikit-learn and the 'PyData' collection of numpy, pandas, matplotlib, Jupyter notebook, and Azure Machine Learning. Also I am a competent mobile developer. My ability and experience are relevant to native platforms using iOS and Android and cross-platform native frameworks using Xamarin, Flutter and React Native. I label myself a 'full stack mobile' developer as I touch both APIs and client applications. For this I depend on Flask, Spring and ASP.NET Core deploying to the Google Cloud Platform. As a tech author, I produce educational video content for developers. As a result, I have gained significant ability with the Adobe Creative Cloud applications specifically the video tools Premiere Pro and After Effects. I also use Illustrator, Photoshop and XD for mobile application design. </p>

<p>Having completed BBA and MBA from the University of Chittagong, I have started pursuing Bachelor of Computer Science at the University of the People, a non-profit, accredited, online university with the headquarter in CA, USA.</p>
<p>Computing and web technology are always at the core of my heart. After graduation, I have started my professional journey as a virtual employee at a Malaysian company named Tandemic, and am its Head of Tech (virtual) now. In 2014, I along with a friend have launched Codist, a tech startup working to simplify human life and empower the underprivileged through using web technology. EduPress is our first creation that automates academic activities. I’m also one of the co-founders of laptopctg.</p>
<p>I believe in CHANGE. It doesn’t matter who you are, where you are from, or whatever the situation is — yes, you can make a change if you want. I love cycling, listening songs, reading books, gardening, and networking.</p>",,2011-06-21 06:34:43.330 UTC,2021-05-26 07:09:48.717 UTC,"Munshiganj, Bangladesh",27,4,0,23,,https://nur.codist.dev/

<p>Closely linked to my technical background is my fascination with patterns, both natural and man-made, and I love creating photographs where the two interact. I am also keenly aware of colour and light, both in their presence and their absence, and the differences between how a camera sees the everyday world and how the human eye does.</p>

<p>As a photographer, the works I create can only ever be recordings of things already in existence or created by others; however by applying my eye for a detail here, or a pattern there, I hope to be able to show people the most common everyday object in a new light.</p>",,2010-08-19 13:03:55.400 UTC,2021-05-01 19:58:55.443 UTC,United Kingdom,263,5,1,23,https://i.stack.imgur.com/B9QBf.png,http://nickminers.com

4367697,Action Coding,"<p>Action Coding is here to bring your business to the next level. Having a professional, modern looking website says so much about your business. I know one of the first things I look at when considering using a business’s services is how much effort they put into their website. Having a professionally designed website says many things about your company. Two of the most important are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>We take our business so seriously that we created this awesome looking site for our customers.</p></li>
<li><p>We have considered every aspect of our business and want to make sure you can access that information easily on any device you choose</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Your website should be your top employee. Marketing is huge for any business and having a quality website is the first place to start with your marketing/advertising budget. Your website works 24/7 to promote your company without having to provide vacation time. What more could you ask for from an employee?</p>

<p>Action Coding specializes in Custom. We are not the company that takes some free WordPress theme and adds your logo. We create a site that is customized for your business. Our main focus is your company. We handle all the technical aspects of running a website so you can focus on running your business. Contact us today to get started on your own custom website and take your business to the next level.</p>",,2014-12-16 19:25:20.900 UTC,2021-05-28 15:56:24.190 UTC,"Flagstaff, AZ, United States",780,9,0,65,https://i.stack.imgur.com/v1ekB.jpg,https://www.actioncoding.com

<p>I acquired a lot of experience over the years. At the beginning I worked with different content management systems and forum engines (such as Joomla, IPB, vBulletin, phpBB, etc.), also I still follow the development of Joomla.</p>

<p>Since 2012 I'm only creating pages developed on my own. Thanks for the new HTML5 Standards, mobile app development got increased popularity built on web standards so nowadays I'm mostly addicted to HTML/JS/CSS combo based apps for phones.</p>

<p>Thanks to the cross-platform compability of HTML5, one of my short future plan is to stabilize my position as a mobile app developer, concentrating on the newcomers this year (Tizen, Firefox OS, Sailfish OS) whose systems will bring us the future of web in our hand and opens new ways for me in my carrier.</p>",,2013-01-18 14:44:15.433 UTC,2021-05-28 12:59:51.390 UTC,"Budapest, Hungary",134,9,0,15,,http://andy1210.com

Wait, scratch that, now I work with Java 8 and Spring and Cassandra, deployed with Chef ... wait, never mind all that, that's so 2015.  Now I write Vert.x microservices using RxJava, custom expression languages processed with ANTLR to query federated Elasticsearch, Postgres, and Cassandra datastores, built with Maven on Jenkins running in Kubernetes clusters and deploy Helm Charts, Docker Images, and Nexus artifacts to varied environments from local to on-prem to in the cloud.</p>

<p>I'm interested in Domain Driven Design, Continuous Integration, architecture, usability, design, team dynamics, peopleware and coffee.  I think code is craft as much as science.</p>

<p>I like design patterns and I like ignoring them, too.  I like Lean and I like Waterfall, and sometimes I like to just throw some code at the wall and see if it sticks.</p>",,2012-02-06 16:28:50.403 UTC,2021-05-27 14:15:05.507 UTC,Akron OH,2040,15,11,129,,http://out.ofband.net

1017121,Christiaan Nieuwlaat,"<p>Hi, </p>

<p>My name is Christiaan, please call me Chris.</p>

<p>I'm a 39 year old, reasonably smart ( so they say ;) ) IT Professional.</p>

<p><strong>""Me"" in a nutshell</strong></p>

<p>I've been programming since age 4 (started by typing in listings in MSX Basic), and learned to develop using many programming languages. I'm convinced that software development consists of a few paradigms (i.e. Functional programming, imperative programming), and in a specific paradigm there are different dialects (which are the programming languages).</p>

<p>As a hobby I like to experiment with microcontrollers and FPGA experiment boards. As a result I'm quite fond of IoT in general, and like to work with assembly and C for embedded projects.</p>

<p>Keywords that fit me:</p>

<ul>
<li>Eager to learn</li>
<li>Certified BizTalk developer</li>
<li>Certified Ethical Hacker</li>
<li>C# / .NET framework / .NET Core</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>Zend Certified PHP Developer</li>
<li>Javascript ( incl. ES &amp; TypeScript )</li>
<li>Mobile Development</li>
<li>Passion for Non-Functionals ( specifically Performance &amp; Security )</li>
</ul>

<p>If you would like to know more about me, please don't hesitate to send me a message.</p>",,2011-10-27 18:36:41.553 UTC,2021-05-21 08:07:31.033 UTC,"Halsteren, Netherlands",1319,17,5,153,https://i.stack.imgur.com/iVW1t.jpg?s=128&g=1,http://www.christiaannieuwlaat.nl

5635258,StephenG,"<p>World's worst piano player three years running and counting !  Reasonably good at photography, computer stuff, a wee bit of maths, physics.  Studied Making Stuff Up and Not Using Common Sense at the University of Civil Service and later watching lawyers avoid common sense like the plague.  Would ban lawyers if (when) gain complete domination of world, pardoning Judge Judy on the basis she's not totally detached from reality.  Addicted to chocolate.</p>

<ul>
<li>Favorite program : Canada's Worst Driver.</li>
<li>Favorite book : Either ""Tinker, Tailor, Spy"" by John le Carré or one of the Disc World novels by Terry Pratchett.</li>
<li>Favorite Food : Is there anything better than Pepperoni Pizza ?  Surely not.  Only Domino can screw this up - a blind monkey could do better than Domino Pizza.</li>
<li>Most surprised by : Suicide By BrExit</li>
<li>Favorite Music : Jazz piano, even the weird stuff.</li>
<li>Least Favorite Music : It's a toss up between Irish Country and Western and Christian Rock.</li>
<li>Baffled By : Humans.  Dogs I understand (like kids without the talking back), even cats (just about the most self centered creatures until they invented overpaid footie players).  Humans remain a mystery wrapped in a soft, squishy shell.</li>
<li>Favorite sport : Real Football (i.e. the one where you're supposed to <em>only</em> kick the ball with a few exceptions, not pick it up and run).</li>
<li>Least Favorite Sport : Golf.  At least doing it is exercise, but <em>watching it ?!?!</em></li>
<li>Favorite equation : The Ideal Gas Law - this thing just never stops being useful.</li>
<li>Religion : Devout and committed Atheist.</li>
<li>Politics : Democracy - keep it until we figure out something not as crazy.</li>
<li>Favorite Comedian : An impossible choice between the late Dave Allen and the surprisingly still alive Dara O'Brien.</li>
</ul>

<p>Bucket List :</p>

<ul>
<li>Clone Sigourney Weaver</li>
<li>Marry cloned Sigourney Weaver</li>
<li>Divorce cloned Sigourney Weaver</li>
<li>Clone Catherine Hicks</li>
<li>Live In Sin with clone of Catherine Hicks (lots and lots of sin)</li>
<li>Secretly think about cloned Sigourney Weaver while with cloned Catherine Hicks, but at least feel guilty about this.</li>
<li>Be sued jointly by real Catherine Hicks and real Sigourney Weaver for the cloning without permission thing.  Would that be theft or what ?</li>
<li>Die</li>
</ul>

Unlike most programmers, I enjoy the fast paced nature of web development, and the constant churn of new technologies and frameworks. It keeps life exciting.</p>
<p>In terms of frontend, I'm currently big into Vue.js and Svelte. I know enough React to get by as well, but I still love Vue. For CSS frameworks, my two favorite are Bulma and Tailwind.</p>

3981743,Muhammed Neswine,"<p>I consider myself a reasonably experienced web software developer with a particular interest in the human side of software development, as represented in my recommended developer reading list. Computers are fascinating machines, but they're mostly a reflection of the people using them. In the art of software development, studying code isn't enough; you have to study the people behind the software, too.</p>

<p>Like most developers, I got into programming because I like creating stuff. Not just any stuff, but stuff other people find useful. I like the constant problem solving, the use of abstractions that exist for long periods nowhere but in my imagination, and I like seeing the transformation into a living presence. There is a joy in the steady work of creation and in its first successful test run. It is both a sense of building and consuming until at last, at long last, I can test the new feature, verify that it works, and feel the euphoric rush of frenetic little wicker gates opening and closing inside me in a triumphant, momentarily ecstatic pulsing.</p>",,2014-08-27 06:51:30.360 UTC,2021-05-24 04:22:13.147 UTC,India,1850,24,16,189,https://i.stack.imgur.com/f0zs6.jpg,

Even sometimes I dream about the solution and I’m not kidding here. As a result I’ve created many pet projects as well but one notable contribution is a bot which notifies about any operation taking place on Gitlab repository.
My motto is that:</p>

1349828,Chris Sherlock,"<p>LibreOffice developer (mainly looking at the VCL module). Constantly looking at this ancient codebase, but always impressed by how much refactoring is going on! Quite an amazing bunch of developers - I hang out on Freenode's #libreoffice-dev channel as chris_wot</p>

<p>An interesting fact about me is that I was three times an administrator on Wikipedia, going by the username ta_bu_shi_da_yu and then later tbsdy_lives. Amongst my accomplishments on that project I invented the [citation needed] tag, so I guess that makes me a little-known but nonetheless minor 'net celebrity.</p>

<p>My areas of expertise are:</p>

<ul>
<li>C++</li>
<li>Java (I know a fair bit about Spring)</li>
<li>Databases</li>
<li>Linux (though a bit rusty)</li>
</ul>

<p>In terms of databases, I'm actually very interested in mainly relational databases, not much expertise in NoSQL databases but that's mainly because I'm not that interested in them - and only then because I find they normally only really fit into niche markets I don't work in. Maybe I'll also drink of the Kool-Aid and become a rabid fan - it could happen! </p>

<p>However, I'm interested in the mathematics behind RDBMSes (relations, relational algebra) and data structures that are used in database engines (in particularly indexes) like hashmaps, btrees, etc. My experience is in SQL Server and Oracle, not a huge amount of experience in Postgres but the more I use it and read about it, the more I like it. </p>

<p>In terms of C++, that's something I am constantly learning more and more about. Right now I'm interested in the STL, but also looking at C++11 features like lambdas, etc. Still trying to work out where I'd ever use an rvalue :-)</p>",,2012-04-22 17:24:31.810 UTC,2019-02-25 04:36:10.590 UTC,"Sydney, Australia",2883,28,2,183,,http://randomtechnicalstuff.blogspot.com

<p>I'm a founder and software enthusiast, based in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>My formal education was in Industrial Engineering, then turned to web development the last few years since graduation, mainly to power my business endeavors as I operate without a technical co-founder.</p>

<p>Came to the conclusion that I must invest my own time in becoming the technical expert needed to lead projects of such a sort, so after much contemplation and hesitation, I am now committing 8+ hours in API development (Mainly Node/Express/postgreSQL) and Angular in the front end.</p>

<p>I am here on stackoverflow with hopes of benefitting from and contributing to this great community as much as I can.</p>

<p>Best regards,
